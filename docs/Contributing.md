### Way to write code
```gdscript
func _something(type : float)->void:
	pass;
	
export var some_variable : int;

var some_variable;
```

When writing in GDScript for Triside, make sure to follow these basics:
- Use _'s as spaces.
- Always cast functions to somthing, void, float, etc.
- Always end a line with ; it makes it easier to read.
- Always cast variables with `var variable : int;`.
